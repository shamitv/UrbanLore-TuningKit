    "question": "What is the basis of Gleamspire wealth according to the context of 'Race, Wealth, and the Light Economy'?",
    "answer": "Gleamspire wealth is fundamentally based on the 'function of light.' This means that the economy revolves around the manipulation and utilization of light in various forms. Specifically, the basis of Gleamspire wealth includes the following components:\n\n1. **Prisms**: These are likely optical devices that refract or split light into its component colors or wavelengths. In the context of Gleamspire, prisms could be used for both practical purposes (e.g., lighting, energy generation) and symbolic or aesthetic reasons, contributing to the economy's reliance on light.\n\n2. **Memory Wards**: These are probably protective or enchanting barriers that store or preserve memories, emotions, or other intangible aspects of a person or place. The use of memory wards suggests that Gleamspire's wealth is tied to the preservation and monetization of personal or collective experiences, which can be valuable commodities in a society where light is central to culture and economics.\n\n3. **Daylight Deposits**: This term may refer to deposits or stores of natural light, such as captured sunlight, or it could denote areas where daylight is particularly abundant or concentrated. These deposits could be mined, traded, or used as a currency, further emphasizing the economy's dependence on light.\n\nIn summary, Gleamspire's wealth is intricately linked to the manipulation, preservation, and trade of light in its various forms, creating a unique and interconnected economic system based on the 'function of light.'"

    "question": "In the context of a 'perimeter moral map,' what is the role of an entity called 'Dhe' according to the provided attribute?",
    "answer": "According to the 'perimeter moral map,' the entity 'Dhe' plays the role of a 'regular customer.'

Additionally, Dhe has a 'ledger of what light bought him,' which implies that Dhe's purchases are recorded or tracked, possibly for the purpose of monitoring consumption, payments, or moral conduct within the moral map framework. This suggests a system where transactions are not only financial but also potentially tied to ethical or social responsibilities."

    "question": "How does Soras, as a member of a migrant family, contribute to the theme of belonging and memory within the narrative?",
    "answer": "Soras, as a character from a migrant family, embodies the complexities of belonging and memory in the story. Their role highlights the struggles and nuances of adapting to a new environment while holding onto their cultural roots. As a migrant, Soras likely experiences a tension between their past and present, their identity being shaped by both their family's history and the new society they inhabit. This duality is central to the narrative, as their memories and connections to their family\u2014whether shared stories, traditions, or shared experiences\u2014play a crucial role in defining their sense of self and their place in the world. Their journey also underscores the broader themes of displacement, identity, and the enduring power of familial bonds in preserving a sense of belonging, even in the face of significant change."
