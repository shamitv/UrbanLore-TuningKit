    "question": "How do archivists contribute to the mechanisms of power in a city?",
    "answer": "Archivists play a crucial role in shaping the mechanisms of power by acting as the 'guardians of the city\u2019s memory and mythos.' Their primary responsibility is to curate and manage the city\u2019s archives, ensuring that the historical records align with the prevailing policies. This process is not merely administrative; it is deeply political. Archivists make significant decisions about what memories are preserved, broadcast, or archived, which has a profound impact on the city\u2019s collective identity, cultural narrative, and even the future direction of policy. By controlling the flow of information and the interpretation of history, archivists wield significant influence over how the city\u2019s past is perceived and how it shapes the present and future. This role underscores the intersection of knowledge, power, and governance, where the selection and dissemination of memories are tools to maintain or challenge existing structures of authority."
