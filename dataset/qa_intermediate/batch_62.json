    "question": "What is a memory shard in the context of the Childhood Kitchen ledger entry?",
    "answer": "A 'memory shard' in the context of the Childhood Kitchen ledger entry is a fragment or piece of data, likely representing a specific moment, event, or experience from a child's past. These memory shards are stored in the ledger as a way to document and preserve personal history, emotions, and life events in a structured or digital format. The term 'shard' implies that these memories are broken down into smaller, manageable units, which may be referenced, analyzed, or shared depending on the system's design and purpose. These entries could be used for self-reflection, therapeutic purposes, or even to help children (or their parents/caregivers) understand their growth and development over time."

    "question": "What is the role of a Light Steward during inter-district exchanges?",
    "answer": "A Light Steward serves as a mediator of exchange during inter-district transactions. This means they facilitate and oversee the trading or bartering process between different districts, ensuring that both parties engage in fair and orderly transactions. Additionally, Light Stewards possess the unique ability to sense 'prism hunger,' which likely refers to the need or demand within the districts for certain goods, services, or resources. This sensory capability helps them anticipate what items or resources may be in high demand and could be valuable during the exchanges, thereby optimizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the interactions they mediate."
