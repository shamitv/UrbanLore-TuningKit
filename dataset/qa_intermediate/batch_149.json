    "question": "What is the nature of the Blue Market, and how is it related to the underground economy?",
    "answer": "The Blue Market is an underground market known for its shadow economy operations.

The underground nature of the Blue Market makes it a hub for illicit activities, where financial gain and exploitation often occur under the cover of secrecy and misinformation."

    "question": "What exactly are 'district glow maps' as defined in the glossary?",
    "answer": "District glow maps are specialized maps that visually represent the current daylight allocation across various districts. These maps provide a detailed and real-time depiction of how daylight is distributed, allowing stakeholders\u2014such as urban planners, energy analysts, or policymakers\u2014to assess the level of natural light available in different areas. This information can be used to evaluate energy efficiency, improve building design, enhance public safety, and support sustainable urban planning initiatives. The maps often incorporate data on factors like sunlight intensity, shadows, and potential energy savings due to daylighting, making them valuable tools for optimizing district-scale infrastructure and energy strategies."
