    "question": "What kind of habitat does the Luminellea marisecume typically form?",
    "answer": "Luminellea marisecume forms a soft, carpet-like structure on resin-coated surfaces. This unique habitat is often seen in marine environments where such surfaces can provide a suitable substrate for the species to thrive. The resin coating likely offers protection and adhesion, allowing the organism to create a dense, moss-like mat that can cover significant areas. This habitat choice helps the Luminellea marisecume benefit from the physical structure and chemical properties of the resin, which may also provide some defense against predators or environmental stressors."
