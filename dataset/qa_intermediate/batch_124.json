    "question": "How does the Memory Ledger function within the context of the artifacts described?",
    "answer": "The Memory Ledger is a public archive that serves as a detailed record of interactions involving the sharing of light among individuals or entities. It specifically tracks two main aspects: first, who has shared light with others, and second, who has withheld it. Additionally, the ledger documents how these choices\u2014whether to share or withhold light\u2014have affected their kin or communities over time. This system likely aims to promote accountability, transparency, and perhaps even ethical behavior regarding the use of light, which could be a metaphorical or literal resource. By maintaining such records, the Memory Ledger ensures that the consequences of these actions are visible to all, reinforcing the idea that decisions impact not only the individual making them but also those connected to them through kin or communal bonds."
