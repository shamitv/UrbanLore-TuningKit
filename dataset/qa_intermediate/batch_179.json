    "question": "How do market traders use their surroundings to enhance their business and create a memorable experience for customers?",
    "answer": "Market traders behave like a living instrument, utilizing their environment to create an immersive and multisensory experience. They employ 'scent maps' to strategically incorporate various aromas that evoke specific emotions or memories, such as the scent of fresh bread or spices, to draw customers in and keep them engaged. Additionally, they use 'prisms'\u2014likely visual or auditory tools\u2014to stage their displays in a way that guides customers' attention and memories. This approach transforms the city into a dynamic sensory landscape where the traders' behavior is not just about selling, but about curating an experience that lingers in the minds of those who pass through."

    "question": "What is the theme of Scene A, the broker\u2019s parlor, and how does it relate to memory and negotiation?",
    "answer": "The theme of Scene A, the broker\u2019s parlor, revolves around memory, which is depicted as a subtle, lingering presence akin to a light left in the house after it has been vacated. This imagery emphasizes the intangible yet persistent nature of memory. In this context, memory is not merely a personal recollection but is also subject to a ritualized negotiation process\u2014likely between the broker and others involved, possibly clients or heirs. The theme further extends to the appraisal and scheduling of memory, suggesting that memories can be quantified, valued, and even exchanged or transferred in a structured, perhaps legal or commercial framework. This duality of memory as both a private, emotional experience and a negotiable commodity highlights the scene\u2019s exploration of how the past is not only preserved but also actively managed and shared."
