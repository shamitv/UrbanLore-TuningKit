    "question": "What is a common phrase used when someone cannot stand the light in a gray market context?",
    "answer": "In a gray market context, a common phrase used when someone cannot stand the light is 'borrow a little memory instead.' This expression suggests an alternative to facing or tolerating something that is unpleasant or overwhelming, perhaps by temporarily ignoring or distracting oneself from the situation, much like borrowing a memory to cope with the present. In the gray market, where items may be second-hand, pre-owned, or otherwise not officially authorized, this phrase could imply dealing with products that may not be perfect or in their original condition, thus requiring a more flexible or patient approach."

    "question": "What are the key elements of the House of Stonewind's memory trait, and how do they reflect its emphasis on consent and attribution?",
    "answer": "The House of Stonewind's memory trait encompasses three primary elements: geology, the winds, and foundational myths. Geology represents the enduring physical presence and roots of the House, symbolizing its deep connection to the land and the stability it provides to its members and allies. The winds, meanwhile, embody the ever-changing nature of the world and the need for adaptability, often used to convey messages or warnings through their patterns and direction. Foundational myths are the stories and legends that shape the House\u2019s identity, passed down through generations to preserve history and wisdom. Together, these elements highlight the House\u2019s emphasis on consent and attribution by ensuring that all knowledge and influence are shared with permission and given proper credit to their original sources or storytellers. This approach fosters mutual respect, transparency, and a sense of collective responsibility within the House and among those it interacts with."

    "question": "Dorian mentioned that prisms have a special attribute during the conversation. What is that attribute and how does it work?",
    "answer": "Dorian describes the attribute of prisms as both storing memory and light. This unique property means that prisms hold onto the memories and light they encounter. When prisms share their light with others, it not only illuminates but also gives life to those who receive it. This could imply a symbolic or metaphorical connection between light, memory, and the vitality or well-being of others, perhaps reflecting Dorian's beliefs about the interconnectedness of experiences and their impact on the world around us."
