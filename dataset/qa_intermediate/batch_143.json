    "question": "What does the air taste like during a thunderstorm?",
    "answer": "During a thunderstorm, the air can have a unique taste that is often described as a combination of ozone and lemon peel. This happens because thunderstorms generate ozone through the energy from lightning splitting oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The ozone has a sharp, metallic, and slightly sweet taste, which is often compared to fresh air or rain. Additionally, the freshness of rain can also evoke a sense of lemon peel in the air, contributing to this distinctive flavor profile. These sensations can be particularly noticeable for people who have a heightened sense of smell or taste, or when they are outdoors during or immediately after a storm."

    "question": "Can you explain the concept of 'Memory-Lit Language' and how it was invented?",
    "answer": "Memory-Lit Language is a unique and innovative linguistic construct that is literally formed by light itself. This invention represents a groundbreaking departure from traditional spoken or written languages, as it relies on optical signals and light patterns to convey meaning, concepts, and information. The invention of Memory-Lit Language can be attributed to a fusion of cutting-edge technology and creative vision, possibly drawing from advancements in optics, photonic computing, and even quantum information theory.\n\nThe core idea behind Memory-Lit Language is to encode linguistic information, such as words, phrases, or even entire texts, into specific configurations of light waves. These light patterns can then be interpreted by a special device or a human observer with the appropriate tools, such as light-sensitive displays or cameras, to reconstruct the original language. This process essentially turns light into a medium for communication, where the information is not only stored but also transmitted and perceived through optical means.\n\nMemory-Lit Language was likely invented in the context of exploring new ways to enhance human communication, especially in scenarios where traditional methods might be limited or impractical. For instance, this technology could be particularly useful in outer space missions, underwater environments, or situations where electromagnetic signals need to be avoided to prevent interference. Additionally, the language could be designed to be more efficient, compact, and potentially even more expressive than human languages, as it can convey information at the speed of light and with a level of precision that is not possible with acoustic or written languages.\n\nThe invention of Memory-Lit Language also opens up possibilities for integrating language and visual art, as light patterns can be used to create dynamic, ever-changing displays that evolve in real-time to represent the nuances of the language being communicated. This could lead to new forms of storytelling, education, and even artistic expression, where the boundaries between language and visual media are blurred. In the broader context of human development, Memory-Lit Language might also be seen as a step towards a future where information is no longer confined to sound or text, but can be experienced in a more immersive, multisensory, and interactive way. This invention underscores the potential for technology to not only enhance existing communication methods but also to pave the way for entirely new ways of human connection and understanding."

    "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Veil for the Nightward' when it's used in emergency shading situations?",
    "answer": "The 'Veil for the Nightward' is a temporary canopy made of translucent membranes designed to provide shading for neighborhoods during emergency situations. It is likely deployed to block intense sunlight, extreme weather conditions, or other environmental threats that could harm residents or infrastructure. The translucent nature of the membranes allows some light to pass through, which may help in maintaining visibility and providing a degree of protection without completely blocking all light or air. This system is likely deployed quickly to minimize disruption and ensure safety during emergencies such as solar flares, wildfires, or other natural disasters where shading is crucial to mitigate risks."

    "question": "What do Living Prisms look like and what do they symbolize according to the in-world glosses?",
    "answer": "Living Prisms are entities that emit a soft blue halo, giving them an ethereal appearance. They also possess a language of their own, which suggests a unique form of communication or possibly even a sentient or spiritual nature. Additionally, they are powerful symbols of dissent and hope. Their glow and ability to communicate on their own terms may represent the quiet but persistent strength of those who resist oppression and offer a light of optimism to others."

    "question": "How do the 'Rites of Memory' play a role during a drought?",
    "answer": "The 'Rites of Memory' serve as the only way to keep a shared future visible during a drought. In the context of water scarcity and environmental challenges, these rituals help maintain a collective sense of hope, continuity, and unity among communities. By preserving cultural traditions and historical narratives, they ensure that the lessons and aspirations of the past are not lost, even when physical and environmental conditions make it difficult to imagine or sustain a better future. This role highlights the importance of cultural and symbolic practices in sustaining resilience and shared vision during adversity."
