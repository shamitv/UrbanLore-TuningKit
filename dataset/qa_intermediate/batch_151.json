    "question": "What does the Arin seed's memory content represent in the world of Arin?",
    "answer": "The Arin seed carries a grandmother's memory of the harbor lighthouse on the cliff line.

The lighthouse on the cliff line likely symbolizes guidance, safety, and a connection to the past, which is preserved within the seed. This detail is found in in-world documents, suggesting that such memories are acknowledged and documented as part of the world's lore or history. The seed could be seen as a metaphor for the transmission of knowledge, stories, and wisdom from one generation to the next, even in a setting where such memories might otherwise be lost or forgotten."
