    "question": "How does the phenomenon of 'glow after sunset' impact small businesses in urban areas?",
    "answer": "The phenomenon of 'glow after sunset,' where businesses like small crafts and glasswork shops remain illuminated and visible after the sun sets, extends their commercial hours. This effect is beneficial for urban economies as it allows these shops to continue operating during the evening, potentially increasing foot traffic, sales, and overall revenue. It also enhances the urban landscape's aesthetic appeal, making it more attractive to customers and visitors who might stay out longer to enjoy the ambiance and make additional purchases. This extended visibility and operational period can be particularly advantageous for small businesses that may not have the resources to operate late into the night or on weekends as larger commercial enterprises might. It encourages leisure activities and social interaction, further boosting local economies."

    "question": "What is the role of the Sunwrights in the context of governance during a drought?",
    "answer": "The Sunwrights serve as a governing council tasked with two primary responsibilities. First, they allocate daylight, which likely involves regulating the availability or distribution of sunlight in a controlled environment to maximize its benefits for the community or ecosystem. This could be achieved through technological or architectural means, such as adjusting solar panel angles, optimizing energy grids, or managing artificial lighting systems. Second, they manage memory resources during a drought. This may involve preserving and prioritizing data, knowledge, or historical records that are crucial for survival and resilience, ensuring that vital information is not lost or degraded due to water scarcity or energy constraints. Their role highlights a blend of environmental stewardship and resource management to address both immediate and long-term challenges posed by drought conditions."

    "question": "Why is it important to have baseline light in memory vaults, according to the archivist's note?",
    "answer": "Baseline light is crucial in memory vaults because it prevents fogging. Fogging occurs when the absence of light causes the archives to lose their texture. This means that without sufficient lighting, the detailed and clear appearance of the stored information in the vaults would be compromised, making it difficult to access or interpret the archives accurately."
