    "question": "What is the purpose of Reciprocity Houses in Shade-Defined Quarters?",
    "answer": "Reciprocity Houses serve a dual purpose in Shade-Defined Quarters. They allow residents to trade 'shadowlight' for 'sunlight,' which provides two hours of extra brightness. However, this exchange comes with a condition: the resident must withhold a specific memory from the market. This mechanism creates a balance between the physical environment and the personal or collective memories within the community, ensuring that some aspects of life remain untouched by economic transactions."

    "question": "How does Sunward Engines contribute to the 'daylight economy' by distributing daylight?",
    "answer": "Sunward Engines function by minting daylight each morning and then distributing it through conduits of air and scent.

The use of air and scent conduits may also create a sensory experience that reinforces the presence of daylight even in areas where direct sunlight is limited."
