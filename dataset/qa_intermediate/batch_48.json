    "question": "What does the post-arbitration arrangement for the Prime Prism entail in terms of scheduling and guard duties?",
    "answer": "The post-arbitration arrangement for the Prime Prism involves a fixed rotation of days for Meridian and Dusk, which are the two key time periods governed by the Verdict implementation. This means that Meridian and Dusk are assigned specific, non-overlapping time slots within a day, creating a structured schedule. Additionally, guard duties are aligned to this schedule, ensuring that security responsibilities are consistently assigned based on the predetermined rotation of days. This system helps maintain order and efficiency in the Verdict's operation by clearly defining roles and responsibilities at all times."
