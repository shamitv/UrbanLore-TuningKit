    "question": "How does the description of the morning atmosphere vary between the core and the periphery of the city?",
    "answer": "The morning atmosphere has distinct features based on location. In the core areas, the prisms shimmer, creating a dazzling and vibrant effect due to the interplay of light and possibly crystalline structures or natural elements. As you move towards the periphery, the atmosphere brightens later, indicating a gradual increase in illumination or the emergence of sunlight. This delay in brightening suggests that the core areas receive light earlier or have unique sources of illumination that make them shine first. Additionally, the core areas are described as having a scent of citrus and ozone, which could be due to urban activities, industrial processes, or even natural elements like plants or weather conditions. In contrast, the lower districts experience a coarser light, implying a more diffused or less refined illumination, possibly due to pollution, cloud cover, or simply being on the outskirts of the brightest areas. This gradient in light and scent highlights how the environment transforms as one moves from the central to the peripheral parts of the city, with both visual and olfactory cues playing a role in shaping the morning experience."
