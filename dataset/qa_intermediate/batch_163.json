    "answer": "Rule1 of the 'Memory-Lit Language Principle' emphasizes the power of intentional communication to strengthen bonds and foster mutual visibility.

Essentially, it\u2019s about using language to illuminate shared strengths, values, and potential, both individually and collectively, while avoiding topics that might dim the perception of those you care about."

    "question": "What is the primary function of the Sinew Spires as described in the anatomy of light control?",
    "answer": "The Sinew Spires primarily serve as daylight harvesters. They capture daylight using resonant prisms, which then compress the light energy into living prisms. These living prisms subsequently release a variety of controlled light phenomena, including artificial dawns, memory streams, and microclimate shifts. This process allows the Sinew Spires to manipulate and direct light in a highly efficient and precise manner, enabling a range of environmental and atmospheric effects."
