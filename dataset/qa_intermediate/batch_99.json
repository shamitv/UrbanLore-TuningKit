    "question": "What does the Covenant of Shared Light emphasize as its primary duty in terms of light distribution?",
    "answer": "The Covenant of Shared Light emphasizes the duty to 'share light' as a core principle. This means that light should be freely given to others, with the only exceptions being when withholding light is necessary to preserve the safety of those who are unable to communicate or to maintain the memory of people who cannot express themselves. The goal is to foster solidarity and understanding, ensuring that the city learns the difference between scarcity (limited or controlled light distribution) and solidarity (shared and open light distribution). Additionally, the 'prism'\u2014a likely metaphorical or symbolic element\u2014must be continuously fed with recollections to sustain this balance of light and memory."
