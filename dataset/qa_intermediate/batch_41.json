    "question": "What does the message 'a city is a library of light, and a migration is its new shelf' imply about the relationship between cities and migration?",
    "answer": "The message uses a metaphor to describe the dynamic and interconnected nature of cities and migration. It portrays a city as a 'library of light,' which suggests that cities are places where ideas, knowledge, and energy (or 'light') are stored, shared, and illuminated. Migration is then framed as 'a new shelf,' indicating that as people move and settle in cities, they contribute to expanding the capacity of these urban spaces. This implies that cities are not static entities but rather evolving repositories of human experience, knowledge, and potential, with migration playing a crucial role in their growth and development. The metaphor highlights the importance of diversity and the continuous exchange of resources, ideas, and people that cities facilitate."
