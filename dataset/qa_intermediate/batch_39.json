    "question": "What does 'memory-poor' mean, especially in the context of age structures?",
    "answer": "'Memory-poor' refers to a condition where an individual or a system experiences difficulties with memory, attention, and recall. In the context of age structures, this attribute highlights how older individuals or age-related factors might lead to a 'thinner air' or a diminished cognitive environment, where ideas come later, recollection lags behind, and overall attention value drops. This could be due to factors like cognitive decline, slower processing speeds, or other age-related changes that affect how information is retained and accessed. It emphasizes the challenges that come with aging, where the quality and efficiency of memory and attention may not match the demands of the present or future."
