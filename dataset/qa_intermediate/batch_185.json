    "question": "How do prisms adapt to environments with limited daylight?",
    "answer": "Prisms adapt to scarce daylight by operating in networks, pooling smaller memory 'shards' together into larger 'memory-lanterns.' This adaptation allows them to effectively manage and utilize their resources, ensuring continued function even when natural light is not abundant. This process is crucial for their resilience, as described in the context 'The long arc toward resilience,' where such adaptations help them thrive in challenging conditions."

    "question": "What does a harbor typically smell like, and how does this scent contribute to the urban soundscape and sensory memory?",
    "answer": "A harbor typically has a distinctive aroma that blends the scent of hot resin and damp fog with that of dampened lacquer. This sensory experience plays a significant role in the urban soundscape and sensory memory by creating a unique, almost nostalgic atmosphere. The combination of these smells\u2014warm, resinous notes from the environment, the crispness of dampness, and the subtle sweetness of lacquer\u2014can evoke memories of coastal cities, shipbuilding, or even maritime trade. It contributes to the overall ambiance of a city, making the urban environment more immersive and emotionally rich. The aroma, combined with the sounds of waves, seagulls, and ship engines, helps to shape a complex sensory memory that residents and visitors associate with the urban setting."

    "question": "How do memory gardens address the issue of memory fragmentation during a crisis?",
    "answer": "Memory gardens are designed to mitigate the challenges posed by memory fragmentation in times of crisis by utilizing prisms that hold living memories in multiple small modules. This approach breaks down overwhelming or fragmented memories into more manageable segments, making it easier for individuals to process, store, and retrieve them. The prisms act as containers for these smaller, modular memories, which helps to organize and compartmentalize the emotional and psychological impact of the crisis. By doing so, memory gardens aim to provide a structured way to cope with and process traumatic or overwhelming experiences without feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume or complexity of the memories."
