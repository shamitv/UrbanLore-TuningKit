    "question": "What happens to the main arteries that originate from the prism-border?",
    "answer": "The main arteries that originate from the prism-border diverge into multiple roadways.

    "answer": "Drift-homes are cargo barges that have been repurposed into mobile, temporary living spaces. They are typically anchored along harbor walls, providing a flexible and adaptable way to establish settlements in coastal or water-based environments.

    "question": "What does the term 'High Concept' mean in the context of a core city's design or vision?",
    "answer": "The term 'High Concept' in this context refers to a foundational idea or central theme that encapsulates the essence of a core city. It is defined as 'memory, weather, and wealth distilled into prisms that soak daylight and store it as a living archive.' This suggests that the city's design and identity are shaped by three key elements: its history and cultural heritage (memory), its climate and environmental conditions (weather), and its economic resources and prosperity (wealth). These elements are metaphorically 'distilled' and refined into prisms\u2014symbolic structures or concepts\u2014that can absorb and channel the surrounding light (possibly representing knowledge, energy, or creativity) to create a living archive. This archive is not static but dynamic, evolving and storing information, experiences, and values over time, thereby shaping the city's future and its inhabitants' lives."
