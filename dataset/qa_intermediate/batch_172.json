    "question": "What is the primary role of daylight prisms in architectural design?",
    "answer": "Daylight prisms are designed to serve a dual purpose in architecture. First, they **store daylight**, capturing and retaining the sun's energy. This is particularly useful in structures where natural light might be limited or where energy efficiency is a priority. Second, the prisms **refract the stored daylight as a diffuse glow**, which can then be projected or distributed onto building fa\u00e7ades or other surfaces. This not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of the space by providing a soft, ambient lighting effect but also contributes to energy savings by utilizing passive solar strategies. The structural design of these prisms is carefully engineered to maximize the efficiency of light capture and dispersion, ensuring that the daylight is evenly spread and not concentrated in one area, thus preventing glare and reducing heat gain while still providing illumination."
