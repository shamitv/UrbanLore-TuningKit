    "question": "What are the key principles of the 'Scavengers of Ancestral Recollections' guild when dealing with memories or codes?",
    "answer": "The 'Scavengers of Ancestral Relections' guild operates under a set of strict ethical and operational principles centered around their attribute of 'code'. These principles are designed to ensure respect for the integrity of memories and their bearers. Here are the detailed guidelines they follow:\n\n1. **Never take the whole memory**: This principle emphasizes the importance of preserving the entirety of a memory. The guild avoids extracting or copying an entire memory, as they believe that doing so could lead to misuse, duplication, or loss of the original. Each memory should remain in its original form, untouched, unless explicitly permitted by the bearer.\n\n2. **Never force a memory to mutate beyond its bearer\u2019s intent**: This rule highlights the guild\u2019s commitment to respecting the bearer\u2019s wishes and the natural state of the memory. They do not alter, edit, or manipulate a memory in a way that the bearer did not intend or approve. Any changes made must be minimal, temporary, or explicitly agreed upon to prevent unintended consequences or trauma.\n\n3. **Always leave a trace**: This principle ensures accountability and transparency. The guild leaves a record or 'trace' of all interactions with memories\u2014whether it\u2019s a note, a timestamp, or a small mark\u2014so that the bearer knows that their memory has been accessed and can track any subsequent actions. This trace also serves as a safeguard against misuse or unauthorized changes.\n\nIn the context of guilds, these principles are crucial for maintaining trust among members and with the communities they serve. They ensure that the guild\u2019s actions are ethical, respectful, and aligned with the well-being of the memory bearers. By following these guidelines, the 'Scavengers of Ancestral Recollections' guild upholds its reputation as a guardian of memories, ensuring that they are handled with the utmost care and integrity."

    "question": "Can you tell me more about the origin of the Vellore family's roots?",
    "answer": "Certainly! The Vellore family's lineage can be traced back to two specific individuals: the daughter of a fisherman from Tide Gate and the son of a glasswright from Crest. This combination of their backgrounds forms the foundational lineage of the Vellore family. The genealogical records indicate that these two individuals were the seed from which the Vellore family descended. This blend of occupations\u2014one related to water and the other to craftsmanship\u2014likely contributed to the family\u2019s diverse heritage and skills over generations."

    "question": "What is the message delivered by the Gatekeeper to the applicant regarding memory load and the review process?",
    "answer": "The Gatekeeper informs the applicant, 'Your memory load is heavy. You will be required to participate in a memory-sharing workshop before your application enters the queue for review.' This implies that the applicant's current mental or cognitive state is too burdened for immediate consideration, and they must first engage in a process of sharing and possibly offloading their memories to balance their load and make their application eligible for further review."

    "answer": "The compromise result of the public hearing for Orin's petition was a temporary exemption for certain classes of memory.
