    "question": "How do Memory Brokers determine the value of memories they handle, and what factors play a significant role in this process within the economy?",
    "answer": "Memory Brokers, within the economic context, assess the value of memories much like meteorologists read weather charts. They evaluate memories based on four key factors: authenticity, intensity, portability, and drift risk. Authenticity refers to the veracity and truthfulness of the memory, ensuring it is a genuine recollection and not a fabricated or altered version. Intensity measures the emotional and cognitive strength of the memory, determining its significance and the depth of its impact on the individual or collective consciousness. Portability pertains to the ease with which a memory can be transferred or shared, which could be influenced by the memory's format\u2014whether it is a private recollection or easily accessible to a broader audience. Drift risk involves the potential for the memory to lose its original context, integrity, or emotional resonance over time, which could devalue it in the economic system. By carefully analyzing these aspects, Memory Brokers can accurately price and trade memories as commodities, affecting everything from personal well-being to broader economic trends."
