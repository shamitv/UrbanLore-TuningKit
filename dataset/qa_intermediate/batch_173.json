    "question": "How does the Harvest process maintain daylight by storing it in canisters for future demand?",
    "answer": "The Harvest process involves capturing and storing daylight in specialized canisters, often referred to as 'bottles of light.' These canisters use advanced technology to siphon and preserve the energy from sunlight, converting it into a form that can be stored and released as needed. This stored energy is then used to meet demand during periods when natural daylight is insufficient or unavailable, such as at night or on cloudy days. The maintenance of this process involves ensuring the canisters remain clean, functional, and properly aligned to maximize light capture and storage efficiency. Regular checks are performed to prevent any damage or degradation in the materials used for light storage, which could otherwise reduce the overall effectiveness of the system."

    "question": "What does Section 2.1 of the Prism Labour Ledger specify about the allocation of high-intensity prisms?",
    "answer": "Section 2.1 of the Prism Labour Ledger outlines that access to high-intensity prisms is determined by the rate of community service and memory governance contributions. This means that individuals or entities contributing more to these areas within their community are granted greater access to these powerful prisms, which likely amplify their abilities or influence. The ledger, dated 2108-2110, is an in-world document that likely plays a significant role in the governance or economy of this fictional setting, ensuring that resources are distributed based on collective contributions rather than individual entitlement."

    "question": "What type of vehicle is 'The Quiet Ferry' described as in the diaspora section?",
    "answer": "'The Quiet Ferry' is described as a 'caravan' in the diaspora section. This indicates that it is a large, road-going vehicle typically used to transport multiple passengers or a group of people, often with living and sleeping quarters included. It's likely a central mode of transport for those displaced in the context of diaspora, providing mobility and potentially a temporary home for groups on the move."

    "question": "What is the memory quota concept in Gleamspire, and how do residents interact with it?",
    "answer": "In Gleamspire, the 'memory quota' is a unique system where residents are allocated a limited annual memory quota stored in the city\u2019s memory banks. These memory banks are located under the city\u2019s glass bridges, which likely serve as both a physical and symbolic structure for storing and managing collective memories. This concept implies that residents have a finite capacity to retain or access their memories each year, possibly to prevent the overwhelming accumulation of information or to encourage selective remembrance. The annual quota might also tie into the broader theme of 'The Weight of Remembering,' suggesting that the act of remembering has a tangible, almost physical cost or consequence for the residents of Gleamspire."

    "question": "What kind of surfaces do bioluminescent lichens prefer to cling to, and where can they thrive in particular?",
    "answer": "Bioluminescent lichens are particularly fond of clinging to glass surfaces. They thrive in habitats with double-skin prism surfaces, which likely provide an optimal environment for their unique light-emitting properties. These specialized structures may help the lichens optimize light production, photosynthesis, or even camouflage against predators or environmental factors. The glass surfaces and prism-like textures are thought to enhance the lichens' ability to emit light, which could be crucial for their survival in dark or shaded environments, possibly aiding in nutrient uptake or attracting symbiotic partners like fungi and algae that are essential to their biology."
