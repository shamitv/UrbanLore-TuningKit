    "question": "What is the definition of Rationing Zone B, and what are its key characteristics?",
    "answer": "Rationing Zone B refers to specific areas that include inner harbors and older quarries. This zone is characterized by feasible storage capabilities but patchy energy availability.

    "question": "What does the phrase 'We carry the sound of waves as much as the weight of our kin' symbolize in the context of memory and identity?",
    "answer": "The phrase 'We carry the sound of waves as much as the weight of our kin' symbolizes the dual nature of memory and identity. On one hand, the 'sound of waves' represents the fluid, ever-changing nature of memories\u2014like waves that ebb and flow, they can be both soothing and transformative. On the other hand, the 'weight of our kin' highlights the deep, enduring connections we share with our ancestors, family, and community. This imagery underscores the idea that memories are not just personal but are deeply intertwined with the collective history of our people. It suggests that while memories may leave us (as the next line states, 'When a memory leaves the harbor, it takes a part of us with it'), they continue to shape our identity and the identities of those we are connected to, much like the sound of waves that carries through generations."
