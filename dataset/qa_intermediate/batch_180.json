    "question": "How might future governance be structured to prevent fragmentation and promote autonomy in smaller units?",
    "answer": "Future governance could be organized through the formation of new guilds that manage smaller prisms with greater autonomy. This model would likely involve decentralized decision-making within each guild, allowing them to govern their respective prisms more independently. By granting these guilds more control and responsibility, the system can avoid the pitfalls of fragmentation that often arise from overly centralized or rigid governance structures. This approach would also foster a sense of ownership and accountability among the members of each guild, potentially leading to more efficient and effective management of the prisms they oversee."

    "question": "How does the phrase 'Your glow is your treaty' relate to the policy of light rationing in the context of Section 3?",
    "answer": "The phrase 'Your glow is your treaty' encapsulates the policy of light rationing as a means of social control and status representation. In this system, the brightness of a person's glow directly correlates with their social status and voice in the community. This implies that limiting the amount of light one can use not only conserves resources but also enforces a hierarchy where only those with higher status or authority are allowed to have brighter lights, effectively silencing or marginalizing others. The policy thus serves as both a resource management tool and a mechanism to maintain order and control within the society described in Section 3."
