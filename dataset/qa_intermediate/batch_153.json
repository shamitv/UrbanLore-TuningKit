    "question": "How does the Redistribution Protocol (R.P.) incentivize people to relocate to specific sectors within the Prism Banks?",
    "answer": "The Redistribution Protocol (R.P.) includes a component called 'Mobility credits,' which serves as an incentive for individuals to relocate to prescribed sectors. This policy is designed to maintain a balanced distribution of resources and population across the Prism Banks. By providing mobility credits, the R.P. aims to encourage people to move to areas with lower population density or higher demand for labor, thereby promoting economic stability, resource allocation, and overall system equilibrium. The credits can be used for various purposes such as housing, education, or other essential needs, making relocation more attractive and feasible for those who accept the proposal."

    "question": "What does Clause B-12 of a Memory Insurance Policy entail regarding the replacement of a lost token after a prism fault?",
    "answer": "Clause B-12 specifies that if a token is lost due to a prism fault, the insurer is obligated to replace it with a comparable token. This replacement is not only about ensuring the token's functionality but also about its provenance, which refers to the token's history, origin, and authenticity. The insurer will make sure that the replacement token has the same or equivalent provenance to maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of the token and its associated data in-world. This is particularly important in environments like in-world inscriptions, where the token's provenance can be a critical aspect of its value and acceptance."
