    "question": "How do public plazas with interactive screens and living archives serve a cultural role?",
    "answer": "Public plazas equipped with interactive screens and living archives play a multifaceted cultural role, acting as 'Memory Wards' and 'Public Plaza as Light Engines.' These features foster community engagement and collective memory by allowing people to interact with historical, artistic, or cultural content in real time. The interactive screens can display local histories, stories, and artworks, encouraging citizens to participate actively in the preservation and sharing of cultural heritage. Living archives\u2014databases or platforms that continually update with user-generated or community-curated content\u2014ensure that the cultural narrative of the space remains dynamic and ever-evolving. Together, these tools transform the plaza into a 'light engine,' not just physically illuminating the area but also shedding light on the shared past, present, and future of the community. This blend of technology, history, and public space creates a living, interactive cultural experience that strengthens social bonds and promotes ongoing dialogue about identity and memory."

    "question": "What does the Light Output Index (LOI) color-coding system indicate in the Annual Census document?",
    "answer": "The Light Output Index (LOI) color-coding system in the Annual Census document categorizes district LOI data into three levels of stability and caution: blue indicates a stable situation, amber signals the need for caution, and violet marks a critical condition. This visual representation helps quickly assess the performance and status of different districts at a glance. Blue (stable) suggests that the district's LOI is within an acceptable range, amber (caution) indicates that there may be potential issues or trends that require attention, and violet (critical) highlights areas that are experiencing significant problems and need immediate intervention."

    "question": "What should a Master-Caretaker do if a prism in the Living Glass system gets stuck emitting only one color?",
    "answer": "If a prism in the Living Glass system becomes stuck and is only producing a single memorious color, a Master-Caretaker should exhale a colored mist to address the issue. This action is part of the maintenance instructions and is intended to help release the prism from its fixed state and restore its ability to emit a range of colors as needed. The process requires the Master-Caretaker's expertise to ensure the system functions properly again."
