    "question": "What does the 'Weather Stabilization Manual' emphasize as the core concept of weather control?",
    "answer": "The 'Weather Stabilization Manual' highlights that weather control is not a weapon but a balanced art. The central idea is that 'prisms seed microclimates and preserve memory,' meaning the goal is to create small, localized environments that respect and maintain the natural patterns and historical essence of the existing weather systems. This approach ensures that any intervention is thoughtful, sustainable, and aligned with the natural flow of weather, rather than disrupting it for harmful or destructive purposes."

    "question": "Councilor Deyran made a powerful statement during a session in the Council Hall. What did he mean by saying, 'The drought is not merely weather; it is governance'?",
    "answer": "Councilor Deyran's statement highlights the interconnectedness of environmental and political factors. He is suggesting that the severity and impact of the drought are not solely due to natural weather conditions, but are also a result of governance decisions and policies.

    "question": "What is the role of a Memory Broker in a given context?",
    "answer": "A Memory Broker is defined as a 'Trader and interpreter of memories.' In this context, they serve two primary functions: first, as a 'Trader,' they facilitate the exchange or transaction of memories between different parties or entities, acting as an intermediary to ensure that memories are shared, transferred, or bartered appropriately. Second, as an 'interpreter,' they help decode, explain, and contextualize the memories they handle, making them more understandable and usable for the recipients. This dual role allows the Memory Broker to bridge the gap between the sender and receiver of memories, ensuring that the information is not only exchanged but also properly understood and utilized."
