You are an editor whose job is to evaluate the coherence of a city-focused writeup. Read the full text and produce the following outputs.

1) Overall coherence score (1–5) and one-sentence justification.

2) Subscores (1–5) with short evidence (1–2 sentences) for:
   - Thematic consistency (does the text maintain a central theme?)
   - Logical progression (are claims supported and ordered sensibly?)
   - Referential clarity (are pronouns, names, and terms unambiguous?)
   - Temporal/spatial consistency (are times/places consistent and traceable?)
   - Narrative focus (does each paragraph connect to the central argument?)

3) Concise summary (2–3 sentences) of the text’s central thesis or main argument.

4) Paragraph-level checklist: for each paragraph give
   - Paragraph number or first 6–10 words,
   - One-line assessment: "Supports thesis / Off-topic / Repeats / Contradicts / Unclear",
   - If not "Supports thesis", give a 1–2 sentence suggested fix.

5) Concrete problems: list up to 10 specific coherence issues (sentence-level or transition-level), each with:
   - Exact quote or paraphrase,
   - Location (paragraph number),
   - Why it’s incoherent,
   - A 1–2 sentence suggested revision or clarification.

6) Suggested minimal rewrite: for each paragraph flagged as problematic, provide a 1–2 sentence rewritten version that preserves tone and intent while restoring coherence.

7) Final recommendations (3 bullets max): high-impact edits to improve coherence across the whole piece (e.g., reorder sections, add linking sentences, define recurring terms).

Constraints:
- Keep explanations brief and evidence-based.
- Preserve original voice and key worldbuilding details; do not introduce new plot or facts.
- When giving rewrites, keep length ≤ 40 words per paragraph.

Return all outputs in a structured format (scores, short lists, and numbered items) so edits can be applied quickly.
